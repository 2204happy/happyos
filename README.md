# happyos
Simple OS for x86 machines


To create the image, (it is already created so only necessary if you made a modification to the code), just run the makeimg.py python script, make sure you have nasm installed though

you can just use a usb startup disk creator with the disk image to create a bootable version of the os

note: will not boot under a UEFI bios

this version contains some of my other assembly projects
-mndl (mandelbrot fractal viewer)
-flag (Australian flag waving in <512 bytes)
